                <h1>Global Temperature Rise is Proven</h1>
                <p>
                    In the year of 1938, an amateur scientist named Guy Callendar became bored during his 
                    steam engineer day job and decided to look at records from 147 different weather stations
                    across the globe. He found that the temperature of the globe had risen 0.3 degreees
                    Celsius (0.54 degrees Fahrenheit) over the past 50 years.<sub>1</sub>

                  <h1>Rising CO<sub>2</sub> Levels Caused by Fossil Fuels</h1>
                  <p>
                    A postgrad geochemist named Charles Keeling compared levels of carbon dioxide in the water
                    and air in a weather station on the top of a volcano in Hawaii. He took daily measurements,
                    and by the time 5 years passed, he had found undoubtable evidence of rising CO<sub>2</sub>
                    levels. He also found that this increase was due to fossil fuel use.<sub>2</sub>

                  <h1>Oh No! A Hole in the Ozone!</h1>
                  <p>
                    Our ozone layer blocks us from harmful light rays from the sun, and leaves us with the good
                    ones that make us tan. Three scientists found a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and
                    thought that maybe this anomaly could be due to chloroflurocarbons, which were used in
                    fridges and spray cans at the time. Their research eventually lead to the ban of these
                    harmful chemicals.<sub>3</sub>

                <p>
                    A group orchestrated by the United Nations created the first worldwide treaty with the goal of lessening
                    greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to avoid climate change. At this point, this treaty has been signed
                    by 197 countries and is still followed today. This treaty also led to other climate treaties, like the
                    Kyoto Protocol in 1995.<sub>4</sub>

                    A group of about 50,000 scientists, students, and others across the world came together to study our north
                    and south poles. They discovered that the Greenland, Atlantic, and Arctic sea ice were all melting at paces
                    unseen in the past.<sub>5</sub>

                <p>
                    Because it hasn't been taken seriously, the effects of climate change are something we will have to live with
                    for now. Scientists believe the global temperature will increase by almost 3 degrees Fahrenheit in the next
                    20 years. This temperature rise may not seem like much, but it causes intense weather like floods, heavy rainstorms,
                    droughts, and other catastrophic climate events.
