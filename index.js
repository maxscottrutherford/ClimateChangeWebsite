ACT ON CLIMATE NOW
Climate change is a problem that we should all be familiar with by now. We hear about it on the news, on social media, in daily conversation, but people still refuse to see the issue for what it is. Rising sea levels, catastrophic weather, and crop failure are just a few of the consequences we will observe if the issue stays unchecked. The next generation of youth needs to rise up and fight back against climate change. We must act on climate change now.
