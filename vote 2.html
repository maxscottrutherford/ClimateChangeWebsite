                Vote! The most effective way to truly make a difference towards the climate crisis
                is to go out there and exercise your right as an American citizen. People may say 
                "Oh, I don't have time", but voting has become so much more convenient for the average
                American citizen in the past few years. Some states, like California, even allow you
                to just mail in your ballot from home. People need to understand that we take our right
                to vote for granted. Most people around the world don't have any voice in their
                government. With this privilege, we need to use it to strive towards a better planet,
                one that doesn't emit tons of fossil fuels or overuse resources. When you vote, or
                become able to vote in one of the next elections, do some research on whether there's
                any environmental legislation passing. There's usually always something, just watch out
                for the wording of the bill. Sometimes legislation is written up in a way that makes 
                it confusing for most voters to understand it (double negatives, semantics, etc.).
                Just do thorough research, and get out there and vote!
